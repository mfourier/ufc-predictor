## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to build a robust **binary classification model** to predict the winner of a UFC fight. The model estimates whether **Fighter Red** or **Fighter Blue** is more likely to win based on differences in physical attributes, fighting styles, and recent performances.

By transforming fighter-level data into **relative feature vectors**, the model learns from historical outcomes and generalizes effectively to future matchups.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed information on historical UFC fights. Each row represents a single bout with features combining:

- 🧍‍♂️ **Numerical attributes** (e.g., height, reach, age)
- 🎯 **Categorical encodings** (e.g., stance, fighting style)
- 📈 **Performance indicators** (e.g., striking accuracy, win streaks)

All features are encoded *relatively*:
$$x = fighter_{blue} - fighter_{red}$$

### Key Feature Groups

- **Fighter Attributes**: Height, reach, weight, stance, age  
- **Style & Stance**: One-hot encoded during preprocessing  
- **Performance Metrics**: Strikes per minute, accuracy, takedown success  
- **Recent Form**: Win/loss streaks, time since last fight, fight activity

### 🎯 Target Variable:
- **0** → Fighter Red wins  
- **1** → Fighter Blue wins

## 🛠️ Modeling Approach

The modeling pipeline consists of three stages:

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Raw fighter stats are converted into relative differences and standardized.
   - Categorical features are one-hot encoded.
   - The final feature vector captures quantitative and qualitative aspects of both fighters.

2. **Model Training**
   - Multiple ML models (both classical and deep learning) are trained on the dataset.
   - The task is framed as a symmetric binary classification problem.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluation metrics include **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

## 🤖 Models Implemented

The following classifiers have been integrated and tuned:

- ✅ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies by proximity to neighbors in feature space.
- ✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective in high-dimensional and binary tasks.
- ✅ **Logistic Regression**: Linear classifier with probabilistic output.
- ✅ **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees with high robustness.
- ✅ **Neural Networks (PyTorch)**: Learns non-linear patterns from complex inputs.
- ✅ **AdaBoost**: Combines weak learners in a sequential boosting framework.
- ✅ **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic model ideal for high-dimensional feature spaces.
- ✅ **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**: Assumes Gaussian class distributions.
- ✅ **Extra Trees**: Randomized ensemble variant of Random Forests.
- ✅ **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential additive model minimizing prediction errors.
- ✅ **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting framework with built-in regularization and parallelism.
