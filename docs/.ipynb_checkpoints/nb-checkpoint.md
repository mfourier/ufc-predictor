# 🔹 Model: Naive Bayes
## Assumptions, Advantages, and Disadvantages of Naive Bayes

🔹 **Overview**  
* **Naive Bayes** is a **probabilistic classifier** based on **Bayes' Theorem** with a **naive assumption of feature independence**.
* It is particularly useful in **high-dimensional spaces** and is widely used in **text classification** tasks.

🔹 **Bayesian Framework**  
* Naive Bayes uses **Bayes’ Theorem** to compute the posterior probability of a class \( Y \) given features \( X \):

  $$
  P(Y \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid Y) \cdot P(Y)}{P(X)}
  $$

* Since \( P(X) \) is the same for all classes, predictions rely on maximizing the **numerator** \( P(X \mid Y) \cdot P(Y) \).

🔹 **Conditional Independence Assumption**  
* The core assumption is that features \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \) are conditionally independent given the class label:

  $$
  P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \mid Y) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i \mid Y)
  $$

* While often violated in practice, this assumption enables fast and scalable computation. Surprisingly, Naive Bayes can still perform well even when the independence assumption is moderately inaccurate.

🔹 **Types of Naive Bayes**  
* **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Assumes features are normally distributed (for continuous data).  
* **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Suitable for count features (e.g., word frequencies in text).  
* **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Used with binary/boolean features.

🔹 **Advantages**  
* ✅ **Fast and Scalable**: Extremely efficient for both training and inference, even on large datasets.
* ✅ **Effective in High Dimensions**: Performs well when the number of features is large compared to the number of samples.
* ✅ **Works Well with Text Data**: Particularly effective for NLP tasks like spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document classification.
* ✅ **Robust to Irrelevant Features**: Handles noisy features better than many more complex models.
* ✅ **Low Data Requirement**: Achieves decent performance even with small training datasets.

🔹 **Disadvantages**  
* ❌ **Strong Independence Assumption**: Violations of the independence assumption (e.g., correlated features) can lead to suboptimal predictions.
  * *Mitigation*: Use feature selection or switch to models that handle feature interactions.
* ❌ **Zero-Frequency Problem**: Unseen feature values in training result in zero probability and can dominate the posterior.
  * *Mitigation*: Apply **Laplace smoothing** or other smoothing techniques to avoid zero probabilities.
* ❌ **Distribution Assumptions for Continuous Features**: For continuous data, it assumes distributions like Gaussian, which might not match the actual data distribution.
  * *Mitigation*: Transform or discretize features, or verify that the assumptions hold reasonably well.
